An Arabian TV show covered our 2011 records and an Italian TV show has requested that we make more attempts live on air this Spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems that our plan to create an established business through delivering a passionate and honest service has worked beyond all expectations, almost unexpectedly we find ourselves as pioneers forging new paths with our records and bespoke event services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As team manager this makes me incredibly proud and I cant thank everyone involved enough, all the team members have been amazing and have dedicated a huge amount of hard work, time and energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I sometimes worry that the team are worked too hard, that the projects are going to become too ambitious, but then I recall how much fun every project brings, even when we’re on the road for weeks at a time it rarely feels like ‘work’. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here’s to another year of meeting impossible milestones with fun and laughter...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ian...</description>

We managed to successfully break the records for ‘highest vertical drop onto a target’ and ‘highest 360 vertical drop onto a target’... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We may have failed our attempts for ‘most rail gaps on the rear wheel’ and ‘highest vertical drop’ but we certainly gave it our all and provided some top entertainment for our event clients...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Words can’t really do our efforts justice so check out this short edit of our world record antics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many more record attempts are in the pipeline.... watch this space.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
